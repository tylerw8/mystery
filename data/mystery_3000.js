In Castle Forrester, Pearl tries to promote a loose work environment to increase productivity but her whimsy only makes the SOL feel sad and achy. The lack of continuity in the first portion of the movie resorts in the Bots complaining to Pearl while Mike demonstrates their point by tripping uncontrollably. Goosio then decides to visit the SOL as a good will ambassador but the Bots hate cute with a vengeance. Crow later presents his report on the island of Malta, which starts with basic facts and leads to a hatred fueled rant about how much Crow hates Maltese men.

During Mike's introduction to the viewers, Tom announces he's changed his name to Htom Sirveaux (sounds the same, but it's not). Pearl's development of a new deadly virus that can kill off half the world's population by next morning is forgotten when Mike hustles Pearl into sending him a movie of his choice, though he should've been more specific with his suggestion. Crow and Tom try pretending to be the ghost of Mike's father, except that Mike's father is alive and well. The Bots begin storyboarding their own productions of Hamlet and even go as far as enacting an all musical instrument version to Mike. Mike and the Bots then play a rousing game of \"Alas Poor, Who?\" and have to try identifying a famous celebrity based solely on one of their bones.

Meanwhile on the SOL, Mike and the Bots plan to repaint the place and figure out how colors affect their emotions. Pearl then douses the crew with a mutating poison and the crew find themselves suffering from various side-effects despite Pearl's denial of the whole thing. Crow then becomes offended when Mike and Tom feel the heroine from the movie looks more like Mary Tyler Moore than he does (even though his hair is a wig), but he gets even when he and Tom inject several rabies vaccination shots into Mike's stomach. It turns out he just fell asleep while eating a creme puff though. Mike then tries to grow a mustache again based on the doctor from the movie and Pearl is only slightly impressed before Crow's bigger mustache proves to be much more impressive. In the end, Tom receives a disappointing package from the Buddy Ebsen Hat Distressing Corporation. - Written by Titus Yorick",

In order to save money on her monkey license, Pearl has Castle Forrester moved to a nicer neighborhood though not with Observer's help, which has certain financial consequences. She later has to move back when she learns she can't dump garbage out her window. After getting caught in a giant spider web, Mike plays the role of dance producer and has Pearl and her minions audition to join his own Singapore-bound troop. Then, after recreating the plane crash from the movie to test a theory, Mike gets bitten by a giant spider and becomes one himself though the resemblance isn't nearly as apparent to Tom and Crow.

The crew is then terrorized by Mikey, the Mike sprite after Crow wishes Mike didn't exist for the sake of argument. Down in Castle Forrester, Pearl throws her first annual Castle Forrester Fair, which involves low altitude bungee jumping and fried ape hair. Tom finds the southern atmosphere of the movie contagious until Mike injects him with pastrami and Crow mimics the younger sister with the patchy pants and platform shoes, but he goes a little overboard with the shoes.

Pearl and her minions are drawn to an abandoned castle where Pearl finds evidence that she's returned home to Castle Forrester (that and the ability to play the piano at will).

        "Synopsis":"The power goes out on the SOL, to which Servo and Crow take full advantage of by looting the satellite. Pearl unveils her plan to take over the world one person at a time and spontaneously starts off with Servo. While dealing with bad cases of Hockey Hair (to which Mike is conveniently immune), Servo defends Canada's honor with a song of tribute, which eventually turns violent when Mike and Crow join in. Mike's immunity to Hockey Hair leads to a case of Grizzled Old Prospector Syndrome and the bots form a muffin-based sewing circle cult while still remembering the need for human sacrifices. Meanwhile, Pearl almost takes over her first follower before he's suddenly taken over by the Traveler's Group. Written by Titus Yorick.",

        "Synopsis":"A carnivorous sea monster preys on humans off the coast of the Italian parts of Florida. Meanwhile, while Mike worries there's a government conspiracy whenever his wallet goes missing, Castle Forrester is mistaken for a cruise ship by two unobservant vacationers, which makes Pearl need ice sculptures from Mike and the Bots. The SOL crew then offend a Sea World dolphin by claiming its intelligence is nothing to brag about, which leads to a Dolphin War Ship attacking the ship not once, but twice when Mike later makes fun of the electrician Pearl sends up based on the electrician in the movie. The vacationers become confused by the movie breaks so Pearl and Prof. Bobo install a filter on Cambot's feedback that makes Mike and the Bots all look vaguely Italian, though it becomes apparent just how sensitive the adjustments really are. In the end, as Crow and Tom debate what combinations of animals would be scarier than the movie's monster, Prof. Bobo acts as the Captain of the Castle (and ... Written by Titus Yorick",

Meanwhile, the movie features a widower and his new bride being haunted by the vengeful skull of the widower's dead wife and its gardener servant. Outside of the theatre, Tom reveal's he's a beautiful butterfly that only blends in with himself, though a series of industrial accidents reverts him back to his original form (though he still has his proboscis). Meanwhile, down in Castle Forrester, Pearl and her minions play a confusing and expensive prank on Mike and the bots using penguin costumes and a non-existent appointment, a prank which the SOL crew fails to fall for twice in one day. The Gumby short has a serious negative effect on Crow and Tom, who try dealing with their pain by creating their own scale model clay based robot massacre. Later, Crow and Tom try to scam a free coffin from American ... Written by Titus Yorick",
